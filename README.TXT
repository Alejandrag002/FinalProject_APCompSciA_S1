PROJECT TITLE: Ap Computer Science A Semester 1 Final Game Project "Catch a Star"
DATE: 12/ 17/2019

Description: The Catch a Star game is based on the viral game flappy bird, with a twist. It involves a single player as a butterfly that collides into stars for a surprise amount of points. While trying to avoid dangerous obstacles that will end the game. 

How to play: The project must be opened via Greenfoot to be ran. Once the project is compiled and the World view is loaded, you just press "Run" and instantly begin. The butterfly is kept flying by pressing the spacebar. That is all the user control that is needed.

Special Features: The stars that  butterfly collects points from contain special points that are not revealed to the player until the end of the game. This is calculated by a special algorithm within the Counter.java class, that determines whether a star is a "specialStar" and if its value is greater than 5. If that is the case, then the player is rewarded with extra points!
